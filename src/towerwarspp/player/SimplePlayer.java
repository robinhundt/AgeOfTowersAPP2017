/**
 * Class that implements a simple AI opponent as specified in the project description. The AI chooses which move to place
 * by using the {@link Board#getBestMoves(PlayerColor)} method, that uses the following formulae to
 * calculate the score:
 * First a base distance-bonus is calculated: dBonus = d1 - d2 with d1 being the distance to the
 * enemy base before the move and d2 after the move. Then a second bonus bBonus is calculated: bBonus = 0 if no enemy
 * Entity is defeated, bBonus = 1 if an enemy stone is defeated and bBonus = 2 if an enemy tower is defeated.
 * The score is the calculated as: score = dBonus + bBonus.
 * The simple AI randomly chooses one of the moves with the highest score. A move that leads to victory is always choosen
 * before the others. Moves that lead to a position in wich the opponent could win in one move will only be executed
 * if no other moves are available.
